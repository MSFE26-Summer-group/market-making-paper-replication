# [Paper Title] — Replication

[![Docs](https://github.com/<your-org>/<your-repo>/actions/workflows/docs.yml/badge.svg)](https://<your-org>.github.io/<your-repo>/)

Replication of **[Paper Title]** by [Authors], [Venue Year].

📖 **[Full documentation →](https://<your-org>.github.io/<your-repo>/)**

---

## Setup

```bash
git clone https://github.com/<your-org>/<your-repo>.git
cd <your-repo>

python -m venv .venv && source .venv/bin/activate
pip install -e ".[dev,docs]"
pre-commit install
```

## Running Tests

```bash
pytest
```

## Code Standards

All PRs to `main` must pass:

| Tool | Purpose | Hard block? |
|------|---------|-------------|
| `black` | Formatting | ✅ Yes |
| `isort` | Import order | ✅ Yes |
| `mypy` | Type checking | ✅ Yes |
| `pytest` | Tests + 70% coverage | ✅ Yes |
| `ruff` | Linting | ⚠️ Reported only |

Run all checks locally before pushing:

```bash
black src/ tests/
isort src/ tests/
mypy src/
pytest
```

Or install pre-commit hooks (done once via `pre-commit install`) to have them run automatically on every commit — this includes `nbstripout` (strips notebook outputs before committing) and `nbqa` (runs black/isort/mypy inside notebooks).

## Branch Strategy

- `main` — protected; requires a passing CI and at least 1 approved review to merge.
- `feature/<name>` — all work happens here; open a PR against `main`.

## Docs

Documentation lives in `docs/` and is built with [MkDocs Material](https://squidfunk.github.io/mkdocs-material/).
It auto-deploys to GitHub Pages on every merge to `main`.

```bash
# Preview locally
mkdocs serve
```
